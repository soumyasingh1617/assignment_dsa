7->Explain the sliding window technique and its use in string problems. 

The Sliding Window Technique is a method used to reduce the time complexity of problems that involve 
checking all contiguous subarrays or substrings in a given array or string. It is mainly used to solve 
problems efficiently that would otherwise require nested loops.

CONCEPT:

->In this technique, we use a window (a range of elements) which moves over the data structure, either of a 
->fixed size or a dynamic size, depending on the problem.
->The window is defined using two pointers (usually start and end).
->We expand or shrink the window based on the conditions given in the problem.

TYPES:

1) FIXED-SIZE WINDOW
The size of the window remains constant.

2)VARIABLE-SIZE WINDOW
The size of the window changes based on some condition

 USE IN STRING PROBLEMS:

1) Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:
Use a variable-size sliding window to check substrings with unique characters.
Update the maximum length found.

2) Check for Permutation in a String
Use a fixed-size window to match character frequencies.

3) Minimum Window Substring
Use a variable window to find the smallest substring that contains all required characters.
